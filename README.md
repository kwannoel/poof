# POOF: Prototype Object Orientation Functionally

This directory contains a Racket Scribble document [`poof.scrbl`](poof.scrbl)
that is simultaneously a printable document and a runnable library,
that reconstructs the essence of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
from the point of view of pure Functional Programming (FP) with dynamic or dependent types,
using Scheme as the illustration language.

To create the document:

    make


To run the tests:

    make test
